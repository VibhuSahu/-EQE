## Overview

EQE is a user-friendly Android app designed to solve polynomial equations by scanning QR codes. Simply scan a QR code containing a polynomial expression, and the app will evaluate the polynomial for a given value of `x`.

The application also features an About page that includes information about the app, your logo, GitHub link, and social media links.

### Example:
> Scan a QR code with the polynomial `3x^2 + 2x - 5`, and EQE will return the result for `x = 2`.

---

## Features

- **QR Code Scanner**: Scan QR codes containing polynomial expressions.
- **Polynomial Evaluation**: Calculates the value of polynomials for a given value of `x`.
- **About Page**: Displays app info, logo, GitHub, and social media links.
- **Error Handling**: Displays errors for invalid polynomial expressions.
- **Portrait Mode**: The app supports vertical orientation for a better user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Java, XML
- **Tools**: Android Studio, Gradle
- **Libraries**:
  - ZXing (for QR code scanning)
  - Material Design (for UI components)

---

## Architecture

The app follows the **MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture for a clear separation between the UI and business logic. This ensures easy maintenance and scalability.

- **Model**: Handles the data parsing and evaluation of polynomials.
- **ViewModel**: Coordinates between the View and Model, processes input, and prepares data for the View.
- **View**: Displays the UI components and handles user interactions.
